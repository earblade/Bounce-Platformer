# Bounce-Platformer

First game made by myself. Simple game involving going up by bouncing on randomly generated platforms, the higher you go the higher score you get & the more difficult it becomes as a variety of platforms are introduced

## What has been made

1. The player is able to jump up on platforms and go up infinitely
2. Score based on max height & individual platforms bounced on
3. Super Jump implementation & feedback in UI
4. Settings menu
5. Game over menu
6. Proper window resizing

## Planning to make

So if i were to continue; these sound like good ideas, but for now the basic premise of the game is done and I'd like to move on to something else completely different
- Launch menu with a scrolling background of platforms that are being randomly generated (like the game except its continually going upwards)
- Add score multipliers to platforms
- Flesh out UI design and style of game including colour palette and examples
