# Bounce-Platformer

First game made by myself. Simple game involving going up by bouncing on randomly generated platforms, the higher you go the higher score you get & the more difficult it becomes as a variety of platforms are introduced

## What has been made

1. The player is able to jump up on platforms and go up infinitely
2. Score based on max height & individual platforms bounced on
3. Super Jump implementation & feedback in UI

## Planning to make

- Settings menu
- Launch menu with a scrolling background of platforms that are being randomly generated (like the game except its continually going upwards)
- Add score multipliers to platforms
- Flesh out UI design and style of game including colour palette and examples
