# Bounce-Platformer
First game made by myself. Simple game involving going up by bouncing on randomly generated platforms, the higher you go the higher score you get.

## Main Level
Where the guy starts on the ground and you press space to initially jump up onto a platform

# ver2
This version of the game will be implemented by giving the illusion of jumping by moving every piece and keeping the player "stationary" according to the global scope
**this is the current version**
