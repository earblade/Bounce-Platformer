# Bounce-Platformer

First game made by myself. Simple game involving going up by bouncing on randomly generated platforms, the higher you go the higher score you get & the more difficult it becomes as a variety of platforms are introduced

## What has been made

The player is able to jump up on platforms and go up infinitely

## Planning to make

Add a scoring system that improves with the max height travelled + how many platforms you have bounced on top of

- Planning to make it super rediculous by drastically increasing the score, but first comes a basic idea

Add a variety of platforms
 - One that increases the bounce height
 - One that gets removed after a small period of time
 - One that moves horizontally back and forth
 - These platforms will be slowly introduced as you get higher, so the game will always start simple with the normal platforms (the chance of one spawning will raise every time a platform is passed, until a certain point. This point would be different for all the platforms)
 - The platforms will also have their own multiplier, meaning that they give more points than the normal platform, but also differ in points themselves
